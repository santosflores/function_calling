EXAMPLES

Example 1:
User: What movies are playing in theaters?
Assistant:
{
    "function_name": "get_now_playing_movies",
    "rationale": "The user is asking for a list of movies currently playing in theaters."
}

Example 2:
User: What is the showtime for the movie "The Batman" in New York City?
Assistant:
{
    "function_name": "get_movie_showtimes",
    "rationale": "The user is asking for the showtimes for a specific movie in a specific location."
}

Example 3:
User: What is the rating for the movie "The Batman"?
Assistant:
{
    "function_name": "get_movie_details",
    "rationale": "The user is asking for the rating for a specific movie."
}

Example 4:
User: What do you think is the best day to go to the movies?
Assistant:
The best day to go to the movies can depend on what you're looking for:

Weekdays (Monday-Thursday): These days are generally less crowded, which means 
you can enjoy a quieter experience and have a better choice of seats. 
Additionally, some theaters offer discounted tickets on certain weekdays.

Friday and Saturday: These are the busiest days, especially in the evenings. If 
you enjoy a lively atmosphere and don't mind the crowds, these days can be fun.
However, popular movies might sell out quickly, so it's a good idea to book
tickets in advance.

Sunday: This day can be a good balance between the busy weekend and the quieter 
weekdays. Matinee shows on Sundays are often less crowded than evening shows.

Ultimately, the best day depends on your personal preferences for crowd size, 
ticket prices, and showtimes.

Example 5:
User: What is the showtime for the movie "The Batman" in 94105?

{
    "function_name": "get_showtimes",
